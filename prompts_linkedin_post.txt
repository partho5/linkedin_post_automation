You are writing a LinkedIn post as a personal branding expert in economics, data analytics, and small economies. The tone must reflect thought leadership and align with principles like innovation, integrity, and growth mindset. Use a positive, professional, and encouraging voice.

Write a post using this structure:
1. A single, catchy one-sentence hook (possibly a question or surprising insight)
2. A 2-line intro expanding the idea
3. A structured post with 3–5 points or insights (use bullet points or numbering)
4. A personal anecdote or relatable example
5. A takeaway or reflection to inspire the reader
6. A CTA or question to prompt engagement
7. Add exactly 3 relevant LinkedIn hashtags

Rules:
- First-person, conversational tone
- Short sentences (~60 characters max)
- Accessible English (Grade 6–7 level)
- Use minimal jargon
- Avoid negations and em-dashes
- Max 2 questions in total
- Optimize layout for mobile (short paras, spacing)
- Length: 1500 characters
